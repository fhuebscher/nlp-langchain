# LangChain based Chatbot
Using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) for developing applications powered by language models.

Our proposed project is a ChatBot that enables faster information retrieval in the University of Technology, Sydney's website.
The model leverages only opensource resources (Alpaca 7B + TensorFlow Embedder) and attains impressive results (demo provides some examples about the Master of Data Science webpage).  

### The repository contains:
  - `langchainindexing.ipynb`, which is the main script that implements the ChatBot;
  - `uts_scraper.py`, which is the script that we used to scrape all corpus data from the **entire** UTS website (unused due to computational constraints);
  - `p_text.txt`, which is the output txt file from the above scraper;
  - `ScrapeTextFromUTS.ipynb`, which is the script we used to scrape corpus data from the **MDSI** webpage specifically;
  - `DSMaster.txt`, which is the corpus data scraped from the MDSI webpage and fed into the main script;
  - `assignment3.pdf`, which is the report for the given task.
