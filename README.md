Using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) for developing applications powered by language models.

The repository contains:

  - `uts_scraper.py`, which is the script that we used to scrape all corpus data from the **entire** UTS website (unused due to computational constraints);
  - `p_text.txt`, which is the output txt file from the above scraper;
  - `ScrapeTextFromUTS.ipynb`, which is the script we used to scrape corpus data from the **MDSI** webpage specifically;
  - `DSMaster.txt`, which is the corpus data scraped from the MDSI webpage and fed into the main script;
  - `assignment3.pdf`, which is the report for the given task.
